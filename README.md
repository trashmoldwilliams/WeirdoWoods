# Weirdo Woods

#### By Will Johnson

## Description

A scrapped RPG project that now is only a page that changes styling based on Moment. The original concept was that the game would be effected by the time of day, and would be an RPG adventure, but the game design wasn't well worked out and I didn't find it worth pursuing. I like the current functionality and would like to expand it for something else, if not the idea in a different form.
